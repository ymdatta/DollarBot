## Installation

### Pre-requisite Tasks

To get started, you'll need to create a Telegram bot through BotFather:

1. Open the Telegram app (desktop or mobile), search for "BotFather," and click on "Start."
2. Send the following command to BotFather:
```bash
/newbot
``` 
4. Follow the instructions to:
- Choose a name for your bot.
- Select a username ending with "bot" (required by Telegram).
5. BotFather will confirm your bot's creation and provide an HTTP API access token—save this token for later.

### Actual Installation

These instructions guide you through setting up the bot's communication and running it:

1. Clone this repository to your local system.
2. Open a terminal session in the directory where the project was cloned and install the required dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
3. In the same directory, execute the following bash script to start the Telegram Bot:
  ```bash
  ./run.sh
  ```
  OR
  ```bash
  bash run.sh
  ```
4. When prompted, paste the API token you received from BotFather in step 4 of the pre-requisites.

  A successful run will display the message: "TeleBot: Started polling."

5. In the Telegram app, search for your bot using its username, open it, and type /start or /menu to begin using MoneyManager for expense tracking!

### Testing

This project uses pytest to test all functionalities of the bot:

Run the following command from the project's root directory to execute all unit tests:
  ```bash
  python -m pytest test/
  ```
Currently, the project includes 100+ tests covering all bot functions.

### Code Coverage

Code coverage is assessed as part of each build. Every time new code is pushed, a build runs, and code coverage is computed.

To check code coverage locally:
  ```bash
  coverage run -m pytest test/
  coverage report
  ```

## Configuration

For **users**, no additional configuration is required—just start using MoneyManager! 

For **contributors**, we’ve designed the system to be as modular as possible, so that updates to one module won’t impact others. However, there are a few configurable parameters available to help tailor and extend the system:

- Adding and removing categories
- Adjusting graphing options
- Modifying the Telegram bot name, etc.

## Troubleshooting

- **Ensure you have a valid bot token**: You can generate a token by creating a new bot via Telegram’s BotFather.
- **Verify token placement**: Double-check that the token is correctly added to your bot’s code or configuration.
- **Check bot permissions**: Confirm that your bot has the necessary permissions for the intended actions.

Alternatively, you’re welcome to submit a bug report in our repository. Make sure to follow the steps outlined in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for reporting issues.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- **External Integrations**: Explore integrations with platforms like Discord, WhatsApp, and Slack to provide seamless notifications and financial management within users' preferred communication apps.
- **UI/Website Development**: Develop a user-friendly web interface to enhance accessibility, offering streamlined access to financial data and resources.
- **Advanced Telegram Bot**: Enhance the current Telegram bot with extensive testing and improvements for greater reliability and comprehensive functionality.
- **Expanded REST Features**:
  - Advanced analytics for deeper insights into financial habits.
  - CSV import/export support for easy data handling.
  - Group expense tracking with features like bill splitting, real-time updates, and integrated payment options.
