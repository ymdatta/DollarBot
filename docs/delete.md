## Functions

1. run(message, bot):
This is the main function used to implement the delete feature. It takes 2 arguments for processing - **message** which is the message from the user, and **bot** which is the telegram bot object from the main code.py function. It calls helper to get the user history i.e chat ids of all user in the application, and if the user requesting a delete has their data saved in myDollarBot i.e their chat ID has been logged before, run calls the deleteHistory(chat_id): to remove it. Then it ensures this removal is saved in the datastore.

2. deleteHistory(chat_id):
It takes 1 argument for processing - **chat_id** which is the chat_id of the user whose data is to deleted from the user list. It removes this entry from the user list.

# How to run this feature?
