# About MyDollarBot's /display Feature's Graph module
This feature enables the user to see their expense in a graphical format to enable better UX.

Currently, the /display command will provide the expenses as a message to the users via the bot. To better the UX, we have added the option to show the expenses in a Bar Graph and pie chart along with budget line.
