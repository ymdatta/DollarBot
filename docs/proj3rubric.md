|1|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation)  |1|[Document](https://github.com/prithvish-doshi-17/CalBot/blob/master/docs/Function%20Description.md) with descriptions added|
|.5|Number of commits: by different people  |0.5|The number of commits by the ID [gggho0806](https://github.com/gggho0806) is way more than the other 4 IDs because he has been working on the testing part and it required him to commit multiple times to see if the continuous execution of test cases worked or not. Which is why, there are many commits with the comment “try to fix test.yml cannot commit” in his commit history. The number of commits from other 4 contributors are comparable|
