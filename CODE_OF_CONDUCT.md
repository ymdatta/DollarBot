# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

As members and leaders of this community, we are committed to making participation a harassment-free experience for everyone. We embrace individuals of all ages, body types, abilities, ethnicities, gender identities, experiences, education levels, socio-economic statuses, nationalities, appearances, races, religions, sexual orientations, and identities.

We pledge to contribute to an open, welcoming, inclusive, and positive community.

## Community Standards

Positive behavior includes:

* Showing empathy and kindness toward others
* Respecting differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Providing and accepting constructive feedback graciously
* Owning up to mistakes, apologizing when necessary, and learning from them
* Prioritizing the overall communityâ€™s well-being

Unacceptable behaviors include:

* Sexualized language, imagery, or unwelcome advances
* Trolling, derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Harassment in any form, publicly or privately
* Sharing private information without consent
* Other inappropriate conduct within a professional setting

## Responsibility for Enforcement

Community leaders are tasked with upholding and enforcing these standards. They may take corrective action against behavior they deem harmful, including editing, removing, or rejecting contributions, with explanations where appropriate.

## Scope of Conduct

This Code applies within all community areas and extends to public representation of the community, such as via official emails, social media, or event participation.

## Reporting Issues

Instances of unacceptable behavior may be reported to community leaders at dollarbot38@googlegroups.com. All reports will be reviewed and addressed swiftly, with respect for the privacy of those involved.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will consider these impact levels when addressing violations:

### 1. Correction
**Impact**: Minor inappropriate language or unprofessional behavior.
**Outcome**: A private warning with a reminder of expected behavior. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning
**Impact**: A single or repeated violation.
**Outcome**: A warning, along with restrictions on interaction within community spaces and external channels for a set time. Further violations may result in a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban
**Impact**: Serious violation, including prolonged inappropriate behavior.
**Outcome**: A temporary ban from the community and all interactions within it. Breaking these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban
**Impact**: Repeated serious violations, including harassment or aggression.
**Outcome**: Permanent ban from all community interactions.
