# Contributing to Money Manager

Thank you for considering contributing to **MoneyManager**! We welcome all types of contributions, whether you're fixing a bug, adding a feature, improving documentation, or suggesting an idea.

## Getting Started

To get started with contributing to this project, please follow these guidelines.

### 1. Fork the Repository

Start by forking the main repository on GitHub. This creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

- Navigate to [MoneyManager GitHub Repo](https://github.com/gitsetgopack/MoneyManager)
- Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner.

### 2. Clone Your Fork

Once you've forked the repository, clone your fork locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/MoneyManager.git
cd MoneyManager
```

Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username.

### 3. Set Up Environment

To set up the environment, use the following command to install dependencies:

```bash
make install
```

This will install all necessary Python packages and set up the pre-commit hooks.

### 4. Create a Branch

It's good practice to create a new branch for each change. This makes it easier to submit pull requests.

```bash
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
```

Replace `feature/new-feature` with a meaningful name for your branch.

### 5. Make Changes

Make your changes to the codebase. Ensure you write unit tests if applicable.

To run tests locally:

```bash
make test
```

### 6. Run Formatters and Linters

Before committing, make sure your code is formatted correctly:

```bash
make fix
```

This command will run `black` and `isort` to ensure the code style is consistent.

### 7. Commit Changes

Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added a new feature to manage categories"
```

### 8. Push Changes

Push your changes to your forked repository:

```bash
git push origin feature/new-feature
```

### 9. Submit a Pull Request

Once you've pushed your changes, go to the main repository on GitHub and submit a pull request (PR) from your forked repository.

- Navigate to your fork on GitHub.
- Click **Compare & Pull Request**.
- Provide a clear and concise description of your changes in the PR description.
